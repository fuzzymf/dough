# Dough

Dough is a command-line tool written in Rust that allows you to create and present presentations using Markdown. It provides a simple and customizable way to create presentation decks and present them in both terminal and HTML modes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- Clap library: clap = "2"
- Paris library: paris = "0.5"

### Installation

Clone the Dough repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fuzzymfx/dough.git

```

Navigate to the Dough project directory:

```bash
cd dough
```

Build the project using Cargo:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

Install the binary:

```bash
cargo install --path .
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"

```

### Usage

Dough provides two main subcommands: new and present.

#### Creating a New Project

```bash
dough new <project-name> [--template <template-name>]
```

`<project-name>`: The name of the new project (required).
--template `<template-name>`: Choose a template for the project (default is "default").
Example:

```bash
dough new my_presentation --template fancy_template
```

You can add new `templates` under the templates folder. Each template is a folder containing a `template.md` file that contains the template's Markdown code.
<!-- You can also add a `template.css` file to add custom CSS styling to the template. -->

#### Presenting a Deck

```bash
dough present <project-name> [--mode <presentation-mode>]
```

`<project-name>`: The name of the project to present (required).
--mode `<presentation-mode>`: Choose the mode of presentation: "html" or "term" (default is "term").
Example:

```bash
dough present my_presentation --mode html
```

#### Navigating through the Presentation

You can use arrow keys to navigate: right and left arrows to move between slides, and up and down arrows to move between lines.
Vim keybindings are also supported: `h` and `l` to move between slides, and `j` and `k` to move between lines.
The letters are case-insensitive.
`q` to quit the presentation.
