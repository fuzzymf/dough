# Dough

Dough is a command-line tool written in Rust that allows you to create and present presentations using Markdown. It provides a simple and customizable way to create presentation decks and present them in both terminal and HTML modes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- Clap library: clap = "2"
- Paris library: paris = "0.5"

### Installation

Clone the Dough repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fuzzymfx/dough.git

```

Navigate to the Dough project directory:

```bash
cd dough
```

Build the project using Cargo:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

Install the binary:

```bash
cargo install --path .
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"

```

### Usage

**Without templates**

Create a new dir and create your presentations using markdown:

```bash
dough present <project-name> [directory name]
```

Dough provides two main subcommands: new and present. 

#### Creating a New Project

**With templates**

```bash
dough new <project-name> [--template <template-name>]
```

<img width="422" alt="example" src="https://github.com/fuzzymfx/dough/assets/69160388/ecfb47c2-8fa9-4cb4-9425-0283e0675a6e">

`<project-name>`: The name of the new project (required).
--template `<template-name>`: Choose a template for the project (default is "default").
Example:

```bash
dough new my_presentation --template fancy_template
```

Currently, there are three templates:

- `default`
- `code`
- `light`

You can add new `templates` under the templates folder. Each template is a folder containing a `template.md` file that contains the template's Markdown code.
<!-- You can also add a `template.css` file to add custom CSS styling to the template. -->

#### Presenting a Deck

```bash
dough present <project-name> [--mode <presentation-mode>]
```

`<project-name>`: The name of the project to present (required).
--mode `<presentation-mode>`: Choose the mode of presentation: "html" or "term" (default is "term").
Example:

```bash
dough present my_presentation --mode html
```

#### Navigating through the Presentation

- `t` :
  - `highlighting` mode
  - `scrolling` mode
- `q`, `Esc`, or `ctrl + c` to quit the presentation.
- `ctrl + r` to refresh the presentation.
- `l` or `right arrow` to move to the next slide.
- `h` or `left arrow` to move to the previous slide.
- `j` or `down arrow` to move to the next line.
- `k` or `up arrow` to move to the previous line.

The `t` key is used to toggle between **highlighting** and **scrolling** modes. In highlighting mode, you can use the arrow keys to navigate between slides. In scrolling mode, you can use the arrow keys to scroll through the content of the current slide.

You can use arrow keys to navigate: right and left arrows to move between slides, and up and down arrows to move between lines.
Vim keybindings are also supported: `h` and `l` to move between slides, and `j` and `k` to move between lines.
The letters are case-insensitive.

#### Customizing the Presentation

You can customize the presentation by modifying the `style.yml` file in the project directory. The `config.yaml` file contains the default style settings for the terminal markdown renderer.

```yaml
# This file contains the default style settings for the terminal markdown renderer.

# Markdown styles
h1: red
h2: yellow
h3: green
h4: cyan
h5: blue
h6: purple
code: black on white
blockquote: black on white
ordered_list_bullet: yellow
unordered_list_bullet: yellow
ordered_list: white
unordered_list: white
link_text: black
link_url: blue
thematic_break: white on black

# Terminal styles

# clear will clear the terminal before rendering, you would need to scroll down to render each line
clear: false

box: false
box_color: black on white

# vertical_alignment will vertically align the text to the middle of the terminal
vertical_alignment: true

# horizontal_alignment will horizontally align the text to the middle of the terminal
horizontal_alignment: true

# syntax_highlighting will highlight the code syntax
# this works well with GPU accelerated terminals, but not with the default Mac OS terminal. We suggest using iTerm2 or Kitty, or disabling this feature.

syntax_highlighting: true
synatx_theme: base16-ocean.dark
#themes:[base16-ocean.dark,base16-eighties.dark,base16-mocha.dark,base16-ocean.light, Solarized (dark) and Solarized (light)]
syntax_bg: false

# Displays the slide number/total slides
progress: false 

# runtime map is used to store the runtimes for different languages
# you can add your own runtimes for different languages. Currently, the following runtimes are supported:

-runtime_map:
  python: python3
  sh: bash
  bash: bash
  javascript: node
  typescript: node
  ts: tsc
  c: gcc
  cpp: g++
  java: javac
  go: go run
  rust: cargo run
  ruby: ruby
  php: php
  swift: swift
  kotlin: kotlinc
```


#### Running Code Blocks

Dough supports running code blocks in the terminal. The code blocks are internally ordered in the order they appear in the markdown file. The code blocks are run in a separate thread, and the results are displayed in the terminal.

- `n`: runs the `n`th code block. and outputs the result in the terminal.

## Contributing

If you're familiar with Rust and are looking for a project to contribute to, Dough would be a decent starting point. Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

v1:

- Rendering Engine
  - ~~Color coding elements~~
  - ~~Fixed bounding box dimensions to standardize the rendering area~~
  - Render most common markdown syntaxes
    - ~~The primary issue here is **rendering nested syntax**, lists, blockquotes, etc. The current implementation is stateless and thus doesn't pertain to any information about the previous element. My main focus is figuring out a way to implement this.~~
    - ~~Improve the design of the rendering engine~~
  - ~~Custom alignment implementation~~
    - ~~Text alignment~~
    - ~~Presentation alignment~~
  - ~~Custom scrolling mechanism for more granular control~~

- ~~Templating Engine~~
  - ~~Optional conf file to specify colors for a template~~
- ~~Improving accessibility, readability, and usability~~

v2:

- Improving the rendering engine:
  - ~~Add a refresh feature while rendering slides~~
    - Hot Module Reload( *auto* )
  - ~~Add support for rendering **nested syntax**~~
  - Add a support for maximum width and height of the terminal. Write a word wrapper.
  - Address the color storage issue for multiline elements, ensuring ANSI escape sequences are properly stripped: Refine color correction post-alignment for a seamless visual experience.
  - Enhance rendering for complex markdown elements like links within headings or lists.
    - ~~lists.~~
    - blockquotes.
  - Provide comprehensive support for common Markdown elements.
    - ~~Improve the rendering of thematic breaks~~
  - ~~Improve the design language.~~
  - Image support for terminals with image capabilities is pending. *(Kitty, iTerm2, etc.)*
- ~~Syntax Highlighting in code blocks~~
  - ~~Improve the performance of syntax highlighting. The current implementation is CPU intensive. Use a different library for syntax highlighting, or parallel threads to improve performance.~~
- ~~Custom text alignment: A regex match for individual text alignment~~
  - ~~Improve the alignment of segments of text.~~
- ~~Implement running code blocks on separate threads and displaying results in the current console.~~
