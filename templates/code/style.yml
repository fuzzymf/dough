# Terminal styles

# clear will clear the terminal before rendering, you would need to scroll down to render each line
clear: false

box: true
box_color: black on white

# vertical_alignment will vertically align the text to the middle of the terminal
vertical_alignment: true

# horizontal_alignment will horizontally align the text to the middle of the terminal
horizontal_alignment: true

# syntax_highlighting will highlight the code syntax
# this works well with the warp terminal, but not with the default Mac OS terminal
# syantax_highlighting works well, but at times the rendering might not be perfect with box enabled. We suggest you to try with and without box to see which one works best for you. Alos, consider manually adjusting the indentation of the code blocks if needed.
